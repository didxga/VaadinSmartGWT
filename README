NOTE: This project is now abandonware. We have moved on to a pure SmartGWT approach as the 
expected volumes for our application were mandating way too much ressources on the server
side to hold the state for all the clients simultaneously.

Anyone interested in taking over the project, feel free to contact us.

This project is the attempt to provide a complete Vaadin integration to SmartGWT components.

The versions used are :

Vaadin : 6.7.0
